# Covers by ReadShape

## Summary

### What is this?

So. Books have covers, right? Well, yes, but actually no.

Books are tricky business.
If the book is self published then it might not have a cover or an ISBN.
Other times a book might be incredibly old and never really had a cover to begin with.

### How this helps with it?

No one is going to make covers for these books, but that doesn't mean we can just leave them naked & coverless.
We want to create a beautiful UI so we have to show _something_.

So that is what we do. We will, given the same input arguments, always create the same cover on the fly.
It will obviously not be a "real" cover, but it's better than nothing or just a gray cover.
