# Covers by ReadShape

## Summary

### What is this?

So. Books have covers, right? Well, yes, but actually no.

Books are tricky business.
If the book is self published then it might not have a cover or an ISBN.
Other times a book might be incredibly old and never really had a cover to begin with.

### How this helps with it?

No one is going to make covers for these books, but that doesn't mean we can just leave them naked & coverless.
We want to create a beautiful UI so we have to show _something_.

So that is what we do. We will, given the same input arguments, always create the same cover on the fly.
It will obviously not be a "real" cover, but it's better than nothing or just a gray cover.

### Installation
`npm install this-repo-url.git`

## Examples

### What variance is there?

The covers have some variation. Each cover can be broken down into multiple pieces.

#### Cover color
A cover (might) have a unique color.
It can be the following.

  - Gradient based on input hash
  - Static predefined color
#### Detail placement (title & author)
Details have predefined placement, but it still has the following variance.
  - Top (left, center, or right)
  - Bottom (left, center, or right)
#### Flow field
We generate a flow field based on the input hash. This affects the pattern.
#### Pattern
There are the following patterns we can draw.
  - Circle
  - Waves
